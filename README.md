# Concept Expansion Nodejs Starter Application

  The IBM Watson [Concept Expansion][service_url] service analyzes text and interprets its meaning based on usage in other similar contexts. For example, it could interpret 'The Big Apple' as meaning 'New York City'. It can be used to create a dictionary of related words and concepts so that euphemisms, colloquialisms, or otherwise unclear phrases can be better understood and analyzed.

Give it a try! Click the button below to fork into IBM DevOps Services and deploy your own copy of this application on Bluemix.

## Getting Started

1. Create a Bluemix Account

  [Sign up][sign_up] in Bluemix, or use an existing account. Watson Services in Beta are free to use.

2. Download and install the [Cloud-foundry CLI][cloud_foundry] tool

3. Edit the `manifest.yml` file and change the `<application-name>` to something unique.
  ```none
  applications:
  - services:
    - concept-expansion-service
    name: <application-name>
    path: .
    memory: 256M
  ```
  The name you use will determinate your application url initially, e.g. `<application-name>.mybluemix.net`.

4. Connect to Bluemix in the command line tool
  ```sh
  $ cf api https://api.ng.bluemix.net
  $ cf login -u <your user ID>
  ```

5. Create the Concept Expansion service in Bluemix
  ```sh
  $ cf create-service concept_expansion concept_expansion_free_plan concept-expansion-service
  ```

6. Push it live!
  ```sh
  $ cf push
  ```

See the full [Getting Started][getting_started] documentation for more details, including code snippets and references.

## Running locally

  The application uses [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) so you will have to download and install them as part of the steps below.

1. Copy the credentials from your `concept-expansion-service` service in Bluemix to `app.js`, you can see the credentials using:

    ```sh
    $ cf env <application-name>
    ```
    Example output:
    ```sh
    System-Provided:
    {
    "VCAP_SERVICES": {
      "concept_expansion": [{
          "credentials": {
            "url": "<url>",
            "password": "<password>",
            "username": "<username>"
          },
        "label": "concept-expansion-service",
        "name": "concept_expansion",
        "plan": "concept_expansion_free_plan"
     }]
    }
    }
    ```

    You need to copy `username`, `password` and `url`.

2. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
3. Go to the project folder in a terminal and run:
    `npm install`
4. Start the application
5.  `node app.js`
6. Go to `http://localhost:3000`

## Troubleshooting

To troubleshoot your Bluemix app the main useful source of information are the logs, to see them, run:

  ```sh
  $ cf logs <application-name> --recent
  ```
